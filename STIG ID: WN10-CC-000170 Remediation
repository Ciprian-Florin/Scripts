Overview

To ensure enterprise control over credentials and application access, the policy setting that allows Microsoft accounts to be optional for modern style apps must be enabled.
This setting ensures that enterprise credentials can be used in supported apps, eliminating the requirement for Microsoft accounts.
  Note: This control is Not Applicable (NA) for Windows 10 LTSC or B versions, as these editions do not support the Microsoft Store or modern applications.

  Assessment Details
    Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    Registry Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\
    Value Name: MSAOptional
    Value Type: REG_DWORD
    Expected Value: 0x00000001 (1)

    Status:
        The MSAOptional registry key was not present initially.
        The policy was configured using Group Policy:
        Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → App Runtime →
        "Allow Microsoft accounts to be optional" → set to "Enabled"

        A rescan was performed and the system passed.

        The policy was then disabled again, and the system was rescanned.

  Remediation Script Used
    Note: The following script addresses the related control for disabling Remote Shell Access, which is also part of the broader hardening strategy:

# Script for WN10-CC-000170 - Enable "Microsoft Accounts Optional" for Modern Apps

$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"
$valueName = "MSAOptional"
$desiredValue = 1

# Check if the registry key exists; if not, create it
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Set the registry value to enable Microsoft Accounts to be optional
New-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -PropertyType DWord -Value $desiredValue -Force

Write-Output "'MSAOptional' has been set to $desiredValue (Microsoft accounts optional for modern apps)"


Compliance Result
    The system was updated according to STIG requirements.
    Registry values and Group Policy settings were properly applied.
    Final scan indicated compliance.
