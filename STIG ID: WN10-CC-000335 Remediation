STIG ID: WN10-CC-000335
Title: The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client must not allow unencrypted traffic.

Rationale:
Unencrypted remote access to a system can result in the exposure of sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, Windows Remote Management (WinRM) connections must be encrypted.

Assessment Details:
    Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    Registry Path: \SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client
    Observation: The Client key was not present at the specified path.

Remediation Actions:

    Initial Manual Remediation:
        Navigated to:
        Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Windows Remote Management (WinRM) >> WinRM Client
        Configured the policy "Allow unencrypted traffic" to "Disabled"
        Performed a compliance rescan â†’ Result: Passed
        Reverted the setting back to "Not Configured" to apply a persistent solution via script.

    Script-Based Remediation:
    The following PowerShell script was applied to enforce the required setting:
# Script to remediate WN10-CC-000335

$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client"
$valueName = "AllowUnencryptedTraffic"
$desiredValue = 0

# Ensure the registry path exists
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Set the value
Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord

# Confirm the result
Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName
