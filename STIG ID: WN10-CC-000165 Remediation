STIG ID: WN10-CC-000165
Title: Unauthenticated RPC Clients Must Be Restricted from Connecting to the RPC Server

Summary:
Restricting unauthenticated (anonymous) RPC clients from connecting to the RPC server enhances system security by mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. Enforcing this setting ensures that only authenticated users are allowed to establish RPC connections, reducing potential exposure to security threats and vulnerabilities.

Registry Assessment:
    Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    Registry Path: SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Rpc
    Finding: The Rpc key was not present at the specified path.

Manual Remediation:
The configuration was manually enforced via Group Policy:

    Path:
    Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Remote Procedure Call

    Policy:
    "Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients"

    Setting:
    Set to "Enabled" with the option "Authenticated"

A compliance scan confirmed the system passed after this change. The setting was then reverted to Not Configured and the remediation was applied via PowerShell for automation purposes.

.SYNOPSIS
  Restricts unauthenticated (anonymous) RPC clients from connecting to the RPC server.
.DESCRIPTION
  Implements STIG WN10‑CC‑000165 by setting RestrictRemoteClients = 1.
  Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  Registry Path: SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Rpc
  Value Name: RestrictRemoteClients
  Value Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1
.EXAMPLE
  .\Restrict-UnauthenticatedRPC.ps1
#>

param (
    [switch]$WhatIf
)

$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Rpc"
$valueName = "RestrictRemoteClients"
$desiredValue = 1

# Create the registry key if it does not exist
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Apply the registry value
if ($WhatIf) {
    Write-Host "WhatIf: would set $valueName = $desiredValue at $regPath"
} else {
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord
    Write-Host "Set $valueName = $desiredValue at $regPath"
}

# Confirm the result
Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName

Verification:
The registry value RestrictRemoteClients was successfully created and set to 1. A subsequent compliance scan validated that the system is now compliant with STIG ID WN10-CC-000165.
