Title: Account Lockout Duration Configuration

Description:
The account lockout feature, when enabled, mitigates brute-force password attacks by locking an account after a defined number of failed logon attempts. The "Account lockout duration" parameter determines the length of time that an account remains locked before it is automatically unlocked.

Setting this value to "0", which requires an administrator to manually unlock the account, is considered more restrictive and is not considered a finding.
Fix:

Configure the following policy:
Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Account Lockout Policy >> "Account lockout duration" to "15" minutes or greater.
Manual Remediation Steps:

    Open the Group Policy Editor by running gpedit.msc.

    Navigate to:
    Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Account Lockout Policy.

    Check the current value of "Account lockout duration":

        If the value is less than 15 minutes (excluding "0"), it does not meet compliance.

        The setting was initially 10 minutes, and was manually changed to 16 minutes.

    The system was rescanned, and the compliance check passed.

    The value was then reverted to 10 minutes in preparation for remediation via PowerShell.

PowerShell Remediation:

To set the Account lockout duration to 16 minutes using PowerShell, the following command was used:

net accounts /lockoutduration:16
