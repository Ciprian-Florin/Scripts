Disabling Convenience PIN for Windows 10 – WN10-CC-000370

To comply with security policy WN10-CC-000370, the Convenience PIN sign-in feature in Windows 10 must be disabled. This policy controls whether domain users are allowed to sign in using a convenience PIN, which helps prevent potential misuse such as password stuffing attacks.
Configuration Verification:

    Navigated to:
    Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Logon

    Policy: Turn on convenience PIN sign-in

    Status: Initially Not Configured → Changed to Disabled

After setting the policy to Disabled, the virtual machine (VM) was rescanned.
  Result: The Windows compliance check passed.

To confirm the impact, the setting was reverted back to Not Configured, and the VM was rescanned.
  Result: The Windows compliance check failed.
Registry Validation:

    Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

    Path: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System

    Observation: The value AllowDomainPINLogon was not present under the System key.

To enforce compliance, the following PowerShell script was used to explicitly disable PIN sign-in via the registry:

# Definește calea în registry
$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"

# Creează cheia dacă nu există
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Setează valoarea pentru a dezactiva autentificarea PIN
New-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "AllowDomainPINLogon" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force

Write-Host "Convenience PIN sign-in a fost dezactivat cu succes."
