STIG ID: WN10-CC-000150
Title: The user must be prompted for a password on resume from sleep (plugged in)

Summary:
Requiring authentication when resuming from sleep ensures that only authorized users can access the system after it wakes. Enabling this setting protects sensitive information by enforcing a password prompt when the device resumes from sleep while connected to a power source. This helps prevent unauthorized access in situations where the system is left unattended.

Assessment Details:
    Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    Registry Path: SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Power\PowerSettings\0e796bdb-100d-47d6-a2d5-f7d2daa51f51
    Observation: The specified registry path and corresponding values were not present.

Manual Remediation (Initial):
    Navigated to:
    Administrative Templates >> System >> Power Management >> Sleep Settings
    Configured the setting "Require a password when a computer wakes (plugged in)" to "Enabled"
    Performed a compliance scan → Result: Passed
    Reverted the setting to "Not Configured" in order to apply a scripted remediation for consistency and scalability.
Script-Based Remediation:

The following PowerShell script was used to enforce the required configuration:

<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Ensures the system prompts for a password when resuming from sleep while plugged in.
.DESCRIPTION
  Enforces STIG WN10‑CC‑000150 by setting ACSettingIndex = 1
  Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  Path: SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Power\PowerSettings\0e796bdb-100d-47d6-a2d5-f7d2daa51f51
  ValueName: ACSettingIndex
  ValueType: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1
.EXAMPLE
  .\Enable-PasswordOnWakePluggedIn.ps1

param (
    [switch]$WhatIf
)

$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Power\PowerSettings\0e796bdb-100d-47d6-a2d5-f7d2daa51f51"
$valueName = "ACSettingIndex"
$desiredValue = 1

# Create the registry path if it doesn't exist
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Apply the setting
if ($WhatIf) {
    Write-Host "WhatIf: would set $valueName = $desiredValue at $regPath"
} else {
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord
    Write-Host "Set $valueName = $desiredValue at $regPath"
}

# Verify the result
Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName

Post-Remediation Verification:
    The registry key and value were successfully created and verified.
    ACSettingIndex is set to 1 (REG_DWORD), enforcing the password prompt when the device resumes from sleep while plugged in.
    A follow-up compliance scan confirmed the system is now compliant with STIG ID: WN10-CC-000150.
