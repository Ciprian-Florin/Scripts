STIG ID: WN10-CC-000275
Title: Local drives must be prevented from sharing with Remote Desktop Session Hosts.

Summary:
Restricting users from sharing their local drives with Remote Desktop Session Hosts helps mitigate the risk of data leakage, malware transmission, and unauthorized data exfiltration. This control enforces strict separation between local and remote environments, thereby supporting data protection, auditability, and compliance with organizational security policies.

Assessment Details:

    Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

    Registry Path: \SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\

    Observation: The registry value fDisableCdm was not present at the specified path.

Manual Remediation (Initial):

    Navigated to:
    Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Remote Desktop Services >> Remote Desktop Session Host >> Device and Resource Redirection

    Configured the policy “Do not allow drive redirection” to "Enabled"

    Performed a compliance scan → Result: Passed

    Reverted the setting to "Not Configured" in order to apply a persistent fix via script.

Script-Based Remediation:

The following PowerShell script was used to enforce the required setting:

<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Disables drive redirection for Remote Desktop Session Hosts.
.DESCRIPTION
  Enforces STIG WN10‑CC‑000275 by setting fDisableCdm = 1.
  Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  Path: SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services
  ValueName: fDisableCdm
  ValueType: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1
.EXAMPLE
  .\Disable-RDPDriveRedirection.ps1
#>

param (
    [switch]$WhatIf
)

$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services"
$valueName = "fDisableCdm"
$desiredValue = 1

# Create path if it doesn't exist
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Apply the setting
if ($WhatIf) {
    Write-Host "WhatIf: would set $valueName = $desiredValue at $regPath"
} else {
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -Value $desiredValue -Type DWord
    Write-Host "Set $valueName = $desiredValue at $regPath"
}

# Verify result
Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName

Post-Remediation Verification:
    Confirmed the registry key exists.
    fDisableCdm is present and correctly set to 1 (REG_DWORD).
    Subsequent compliance scan validated the remediation as successful.
